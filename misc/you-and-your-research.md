# You and Your Research

This is summary of an insightful speech, given by Richar Hamming about "You and Your Research". The full video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw).

In research, or in being successful, what matters is working on:
* The right problem
  * These are problems which are important and you can conceivably solve (proving an adequate amount of courage)
* At The right time
  * Prioritize problems where you have an approach, but which are important.
* With The right approach
  * This is the real creative part of research.

* Succeeding in this is a mixture of luck and effort. As Pasteur said: "luck favors the prepared mind"
  * Luck will come eventually, "the lightning will strike"
  * But how do you develop "the prepared mind"

* Preparedness:
  * Work hard
    * Focus on your research and always mull and learn and try to create. Even if it pure luck, more time can't hurt.

  * Be open
    * This allows for the use of one of the strongest resources you have- your peers.Â 
    * Learn everything you can, be open to change, but always be critical of it too.
    * Your peers will help you get a sense of what is important in your field.

  * Be introspective
    * Always "take a wider view, really see it, and describe what's going on there" (again, Dillard) as far as research goes. Ask yourself: "what is important in my field?"
    * Try to consider the problems you face and readjust them and make them either more solvable or more important
    * Learn from your successes, and find the essence of the methodology that lead to success, then try to apply that more broadly. Do the same for the success of others.

  * Work Broadly
    * Always try to at least understand the basics of all of your field.
    * Interwork every piece of knowledge you have into a huge web of understanding, so that novel and interesting connections are more easily and readily made.
    * Be comfortable with ambiguity, but simultaneously always striving to broaden and deepen your knowledge.
  
* Know how to communicate
  * Communication is at the core of participating in the scientific community, so learn to communicate at three levels:
    * Professionally: in the written word, like in your publications.
    * Semi-professionally: communicating in an impromptu manner but in a professional context to your peers. This will be the bulk of your communication.
    * Informally, both to peers, but more importantly to layman.
